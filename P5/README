## Name

smash

## Synopsis

Smash is a program that replicates the functioniality of the bash shell, to an extent.
Here in project six, support was added for external commands, using the fork/exec/wait 
functions to spawn a child process to run bash commands. It also supports several internal
commands, built in previous iteratios of the program.

## Description

Ensure all necessary files are in the same directory: Makefile, commands.c, history.c, 
history.h, smash.c, and history.h. Compile with "make", clean with "make clean". 

The program at this point is built to execute internal and external commands. Built
in internal commands are the cd, history, and exit functions. The cd function will change
directories, if it exists. History will display all user entered commands, valid or invalid, 
up to a max printout of 10, only the most recent 10 will be shown. Exit will exit smash.

The program also supports external commands, using the execvp function to spawn a child
process and execute commands supported by the bash shell.
